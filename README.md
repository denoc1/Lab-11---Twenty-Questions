# Lab-11---Twenty-ish-Questions

You may do this assignment with a partner or individually.  If you are submitting with a partner, be sure both partners' names are listed in the header.

Twenty questions is a game played often between two people. One person thinks of something (say, an animal) and the other person asks yes/no questions to try to guess what the item is.  In your program, the user is the player thinking of the item and the computer will ask the questions. (WE ARE NOT DOING 20 QUESTIONS though!)
Instead of guessing an animal, choose a movie, song, singer or athlete, etc.  Spend some time planning your questions on paper.  **You must submit your decision tree written out in addition to your code.**

After you have designed your decision tree, begin coding.  Hint:  Only do a few statements at a time before you enter everything!  Get a section working before expanding the code.  

**Requirements** 
- Submit your decision tree on a piece of paper or electronic version

Code Requirements-
-	Header including the names of each person who worked on the project, date, project title and project description 
-	Programming comments should be included for each logical block of code.
-	Program should ask the user to think of an <item in selected set> . (Ex.  Actor, movie, athlete, etc.)
-	The computer should ask the user a yes-no question.  The user should enter “y” or “n”.
-	Based on that prompt, the computer either follows up with another question, or makes a guess.
-	This program may continue for a few guesses.
-	Requirement – Your program should have at least **6 different results** as potential outputs.  Note, this does not mean there will always be 4 questions…Just 6 different potential outputs.
-	Output should be easy to read, with no typographical errors.

**Bonus (optional) ** – Make the guesses case INsensitive.  That is, if the user enters a “Y” or “y” it records a yes and if the user enters a “n” or “N” it registers as a no.
